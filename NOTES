Possible Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - See GHC trac ticket #1852. Floats are padded to word size (4 extra bytes
 on a 64 bit machine) by putting an appropriate CmmLit before them. On fasm
 this is nessecary and forces the NCG to produce correct code. On viaC, this
 isn't nessecary so it strips this padding out. What approach does llvm need?

 - When converting Rational's to floats and doubles, we use special tags for
 unrepresentable numbers, such as NAN, INFINITY... ect. Not sure if this is
 actual valid in LLVM. NO they aren't, need to encode to real numbers.

 - Can't seem to find any evidence of pointer tagging. Is it still used?

 - Check that the approach taken for CmmBlock and CmmLabelDiff off in CmmData
 sections is correct.
 
 - Should I be converting CmmString's like I am into ASCII form when I can and
 hex otherwise? If the string is pure 16bit unicode will this be fine? Maybe
 I should be making them an array of 8 bit numbers?

 - Check the Integer to Int conversion is OK. Am I printing signed/unsigned
 correctly?
 
 - Do I need to handle the GcPtr CmmType differently from just a bit type?
 
 - Should I be using FiniteMap instead of Data.Map?

 - SPARC/CodeGen/Gen32.hs seems to have a few special cases for CmmMachOp.
 Perhaps these should also be handled in LLVM to improve performance?

 - tail call only supported on x86/x86-64 and PowerPC. SPARC?

 - Do I need to specify the data layout?


Todo
~~~~

 - Fix warnings.

 - Improve Type saftey of LLVM module (e.g split out pointers to own data type,
 to limit where they can be used). More type checking in ppr stage.

 - Use OrdList instead of [].

 - Use a new Monad instead of passing LlvmEnv around everywhere.

 - Llvm module fixed 32bit. Change to work with all word widths.

 - nice function for creating and assigning expression to new local var.

 - return pointer width in Llvm module

 - Look at using LLVM intrinsic functions. There are a few math functions.
 Also, there is a smul_overflow detect function.

 - Create unified cast method, which generates the code to cast any LlvmType to
 another LlvmType.
 
 - Write Barrier function.

 - Casting after function call.

 - X86 stdcall convention.

 - Rearrange some functions and files better.

 - Use LMString in more places instead of String.

BUGS
~~~~

 - Bug with lists of floats ([Float]). Think to do with incorrect size since
 a list of doubles works fine. See ghc bug $1852.
 Update: No, bug in ghc itself, not my back-end. Update to HEAD.

 - Generate incorrect code for Happy generated hs files. Errors with an out of
 range problem.
