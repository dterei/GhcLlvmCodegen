Possible Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - See GHC trac ticket #1852. Floats are padded to word size (4 extra bytes
 on a 64 bit machine) by putting an appropriate CmmLit before them. On fasm
 this is nessecary and forces the NCG to produce correct code. On viaC, this
 isn't nessecary so it strips this padding out. What approach does llvm need?

 - When converting Rational's to floats and doubles, we use special tags for
 unrepresentable numbers, such as NAN, INFINITY... ect. Not sure if this is
 actual valid in LLVM.

 - Check that the approach taken for CmmBlock and CmmLabelDiff off in CmmData
 sections is correct.
 
 - Should I be converting CmmString's like I am into ASCII form when I can and
 hex otherwise? If the string is pure 16bit unicode will this be fine? Maybe
 I should be making them an array of 8 bit numbers?

 - Check the Integer to Int conversion is OK.

 - Fix warnings.
